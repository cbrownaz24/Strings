What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

    None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

    This assignment was helpful in reinforcing my understanding about 
    how strings are handled in C. It was fun to implement common string 
    methods from scratch.

particular, what bugs are in your submission?

    No known bugs.

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

    With our implementations of these methods, no, it is not possible.
    This is because although we know the length of the destination 
    string, this length is limited to the first encountering of a null
    terminating character. The almost-fixes to this problem are the 
    strncpy and strncat functions. These functions have the added 
    parameter, n, which limits the number of bytes manipulated in 
    memory. However, with no way of assessing whether a memory unit is 
    large enough, the above question cannot be done.
